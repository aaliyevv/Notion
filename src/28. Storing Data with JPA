# #28. Storing Data with JPA

- What is the **JPA**

    The Java Persistence API (JPA) is a **specification** (set of rules) for managing the relationship between Java applications and relational databases. In simple terms, it helps you "translate" (map) your object-oriented Java code (objects) directly to database tables.

    This process is called **ORM (Object-Relational Mapping)**. JPA itself does not work directly; it is just an interface. Behind it is a "persistence provider" such as **Hibernate** or **EclipseLink** that does the real work.

- Why JPA
    - **Independence:** It is easier to change the database (for example, from MySQL to PostgreSQL).
    - **Productivity:** Instead of writing SQL queries directly, you work with Java objects, which makes the code more readable and manageable.
    - **Standardization:** Provides a unified approach to working with data in the Java ecosystem.
- Entity Mapping

    A Java class that corresponds to a table in a database is called an Entity. We use special annotations to tell JPA that this class is a table.

- Main Annotations
    - `@Entity`: Indicates that this class is a database entity.
    - `@Table(name = "users")`: (Optional) Indicates the table name if the table name is different from the class name.
    - `@Id`: Indicates that this field is the primary key in the table.
    - `@GeneratedValue(strategy = GenerationType.IDENTITY)`: Indicates that the value of the `@Id` field will be automatically generated by the database (e.g., auto-increment).
    - `@Column(name = "user_name")`: (Optional) Indicates the column name if the field name is different from the column name in the table.
- Example (Entity)

- CRUD Operations

    In JPA, we perform basic operations through the `EntityManager` object. In frameworks like Spring, this process is further automated.

    - **Persistence Context:** A collection of objects (a kind of cache) managed by the `EntityManager`, which is synchronized with the database.

    All changes (Create, Update, Delete) must occur within a **transaction**. In Spring, this is usually handled with the `@Transactional` annotation.

    The following examples show how the `EntityManager` works:

    - Create

        The persist() method adds the object to the "persistence context" and writes it to the database when the transaction completes.

    - Read

        The find() method finds the object with the given Id directly from the database (or context).
