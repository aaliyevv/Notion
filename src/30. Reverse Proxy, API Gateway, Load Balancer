# #30. **Reverse Proxy, API Gateway, Load Balancer**

- **Summary**
    
    Reverse proxies, API gateways, and load balancers play essential roles in ensuring that applications handle high volumes of traffic reliably and securely. By understanding their unique functions and how they work together, you can design robust web-scale applications.
    
- **Overview**

- **Reverse Proxy**
    
    **Role**: Acts as an intermediary between client requests and backend servers.
    
    - **Functionality:**
        - **Forwards Requests**: Receives client requests and forwards them to the appropriate backend server.
        - **Returns Responses**: Retrieves the server’s response and sends it back to the client.
    - **Benefits**
        - **Increased Security:** Hides backend server details from clients. Manages SSL (**Secure Sockets Layer**) connections for secure data transfer.
        - **Load Distribution & Caching**: Distributes traffic across servers. Reduces load and improves response times.
        
    
    **Use Case:** Even with a single server, a reverse proxy can offer a public-facing entry point, manage requests, and increase security.

- **API Gateway**

    **Role**: Serves as a single entry point for managing multiple backend services, particularly in microservices architectures.

    **Functionality:** Routing (clients<>services), Authentication & Authorization, Monitoring (service), Rate Limiting (control overload).

    **Use Case:** Essential for microservices, where managing multiple services with a single interface enhances efficiency and security.

- **Reverse Proxy** **vs.** **API Gateway**

    A **reverse proxy** primarily forwards and load-balances client requests to backend servers while hiding those servers and handling things like SSL and caching.

    An **API Gateway** is a specialized reverse proxy for microservices that also adds API-specific features like authentication, rate limiting, and per-service routing and monitoring.

- **Load Balancer**

    **Role**: Distributes incoming network requests across backend servers to ensure high availability.

    - **Functionality**:
        - Directs client requests to healthy (adds or removes servers based on traffic demand) servers only.
        - Can spread incoming requests across multiple servers using different rules. For example, **round-robin** sends each new request to the next server in turn, **IP hash** sends the same client IP to the same server, and **least connections** sends traffic to the server currently handling the fewest active requests.

    **Use Case**: Ensures reliability and high availability in web applications, maintaining performance during high traffic loads.
