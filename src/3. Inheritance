- Inheritance, final and super.
    - Inheritance

        Code reuse, is a mechanism that allows a new class to be defined based on an existing class,
        inheriting its attributes and methods. This allows for code reuse and can make development more
        efficient. Like Dog inherits from Animal and overrides speak(). This avoids code duplication.


    Public class child extends Parent {}

    When we update the method which we get from parent class we must write  @Overrride.

    If the method in parent class is not changeable we must write “final” before this method(cannot be
    overridden, extended).

    If we refer to fields, methods, constructor of parent we use super.fieldName, if we  need to get child
    (I mean own) field we use this.fieldName.

- Abstract

    Abstract class means we mention it in parent class (without return type) but we use it for child
    class(with return type). In child class if we need to call abstract method: take the arrow above the
    child class, click more action > implement method. Inside abstract class we can use both abstract  and
    normal field.
