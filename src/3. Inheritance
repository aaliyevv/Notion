- Inheritance, final and super.
    - Inheritance

        Code reuse, is a mechanism that allows a new class to be defined based on an existing class,
        inheriting its attributes and methods. This allows for code reuse and can make development more
        efficient. Like Dog inherits from Animal and overrides speak(). This avoids code duplication.


    Public class child extends Parent {}

    When we update the method which we get from parent class we must write  @Overrride.

    If the method in parent class is not changeable we must write “final” before this method(cannot be
    overridden, extended).

    If we refer to fields, methods, constructor of parent we use super.fieldName, if we  need to get child
    (I mean own) field we use this.fieldName.

- Abstract

    Abstract class means we mention it in parent class (without return type) but we use it for child
    class(with return type). In child class if we need to call abstract method: take the arrow above the
    child class, click more action > implement method. Inside abstract class we can use both abstract  and
    normal field.

    - Abstraction

        is the ability to focus on an object's essential features while ignoring non-essential details.
        It allows for the creation of classes that aren't tied to specific implementations, making it
        possible to work with objects without knowing their implementation details.

        Abstraction means defining a blueprint without providing full details. For example, the abstract
         class Shape forces subclasses like Circle to implement the area() method. This ensures consistency
          in design.

    - Example from real life

        the process of making coffee, you use a coffee maker, you follow a simplified process: add water
         and coffee grounds, and press the “on” button.

    - Example of code

- Interface

    Interface means child use only methods of parent class, not the fields. These methods the same
    structure wtih the abstract methods(it means without return type). Inhertance’de extend, Interface’de
    implements’den istifade olunur.

    There is no other inheritance, nevertheless there can be multiple interface.
