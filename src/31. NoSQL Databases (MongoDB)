# #31. NoSQL Databases (MongoDB)

### Introduction to MongoDB, document databases, data modeling, and basic operations.

- SQL vs. NoSQL
    - **RDBMS** **normalizes** data and stores it in different tables, then combines these pieces using `JOIN`. **Data Integrity (ACID)** is a priority.
    - **MongoDB** **denormalizes** data and stores it in a single document. This allows you to retrieve all the necessary information with a single query. **Flexibility** and **Scalability** are a priority.

    This explains why MongoDB is ideal for faster development and large, variable data.

- What is NoSQL
    - **NoSQL** stands for "Not Only SQL." It refers to databases that provide flexible schemas, horizontal scaling, and are designed for distributed data storage.
    - NoSQL databases are particularly well-suited for handling large volumes of data and real-time web applications.
