# DTO, Validation, **Global Exception Handling,** Swagger

- **DTO (Data Transfer Object)**

    - **DTOs** are simple Java objects with no database connection.
    - **Entity** works directly with the database.
    - **DTO** represents the data we send/receive via API.  DTO only includes allowed fields,
    so unsafe data cannot go to the database.

    - Why do we validate in DTO, not Entity?

        - If we put validation in Entity, it does two jobs: business model + request model.
        - Validation rules may change, but database structure is usually stable.
        - With DTO, you only change the DTO, keeping Entity safe.

- **Validation**

    Checks that incoming data is correct before saving. Add `@Valid` in the controller before
    `@Request Body`. For instance: `@NotBlank`, `@Size`, `@Email`, `@Pattern`, `@DecimalMin`.


- **Global Exception Handling**

    Handling errors that occur in the application from a single center and return a neat JSON response to the user. Instead of writing`try-catch` blocks in every controller method.

    - **@RestControllerAdvice:** A class that "listens" for errors throughout the application. (global error handler)
    - **@ExceptionHandler:** Specifies what type of error this method will catch. Determines how to handle which errors.
