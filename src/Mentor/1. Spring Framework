# **Spring Framework**

- **Packets**
    - **Model**

        Our local database

    - **Repository**

         Connect model with database (extends JPA Repo) in order to service can manage our local
         database

    - **Service**

        Via repository, write our business logic with entity to database

    - **Controller**

         Is a User Interface (UI) to show data which wrote to database with service’s business logic

    - **build.gradle**

        Inside dependencies

- **Dependency Injection (DI)**

    Model → Repository → Service → Controller

- **Inversion of Control (IoC)**

    Gives control to Spring

- **Dependencies**

    Spring Web, JPA, h2-database, Lombok, Validation

- **RESTful API, API**

    A RESTful API is an API that lets different applications communicate  (request and exchange data)
    over the internet using URLs and standard HTTP methods (like GET, POST, PUT, DELETE) in a simple
    and consistent way.

    An API is a messenger that takes a request from one app and gives a response from another app.

- **@PostConstruct & @PreDestroy**

    **@PostConstruct:** Runs once per bean after Spring initializes the bean ****(after dependency
    injection). Good for setup, logging, or pre-loading data.

    **@PreDestroy:** Runs just before the bean is destroyed (when Spring shuts down). Good for cleanup,
     saving data, closing resources, or logging. If your app crashes or is killed forcefully, it won’t
     run.
