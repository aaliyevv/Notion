# SQL & Queries #2

- **INNER JOIN**

    Returns records that have matching values in *both* tables. If there's no match, the record is excluded.

    `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, o.total_amount  FROM customerss c`

    `JOIN orderss o on c.id=customer_id;`

- **LEFT JOIN**
    
    Returns all records from the *left* table (Table1) and the matched records from the *right* table
    (Table2). If there's no match in the right table, NULLs are returned for columns from the right table.

    `SELECT first_name, last_name, o.total_amount, o.order_date FROM customerss c LEFT JOIN orderss o on
    c.id=customer_id;`

- **RIGHT JOIN**

    Returns all records from the *right* table (Table2) and the matched records from the *left* table
     (Table1). If there's no match in the left table, NULLs are returned for columns from the left table.

    `SELECT o.id, o.customer_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount, c.last_name, c.first_name FROM customerss
    c RIGHT JOIN orderss o on c.id=customer_id;`
