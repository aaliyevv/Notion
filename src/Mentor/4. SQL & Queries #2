# SQL & Queries #2

- **INNER JOIN**

    Returns records that have matching values in *both* tables. If there's no match, the record is excluded.

    `SELECT c.first_name, c.last_name, o.total_amount  FROM customerss c`

    `JOIN orderss o on c.id=customer_id;`

- **LEFT JOIN**

    Returns all records from the *left* table (Table1) and the matched records from the *right* table
    (Table2). If there's no match in the right table, NULLs are returned for columns from the right table.

    `SELECT first_name, last_name, o.total_amount, o.order_date FROM customerss c LEFT JOIN orderss o on
    c.id=customer_id;`

- **RIGHT JOIN**

    Returns all records from the *right* table (Table2) and the matched records from the *left* table
     (Table1). If there's no match in the left table, NULLs are returned for columns from the left table.

    `SELECT o.id, o.customer_id, o.order_date, o.total_amount, c.last_name, c.first_name FROM customerss
    c RIGHT JOIN orderss o on c.id=customer_id;`

- **FULL OUTER JOIN**

    Returns all records when there is a match in *either* the left or right table. It essentially combines
     the results of a LEFT JOIN and a RIGHT JOIN. If there's no match, NULLs are returned for columns from
      the table without a match.

    `SELECT * FROM orderss o FULL JOIN customerss c on c.id = o.customer_id;`

- **SELF JOIN**

    To join a table to itself.

    When a table has a self-referential relationship (e.g. `Employees.ManagerID` refers to another
    `Employees.EmployeeID` in the table). Aliases are mandatory.

- **Joining Multiple Tables**

    You can join more than two tables by adding more `JOIN` clauses.

    - **Example:**

        Suppose you have customerss table with id and orderss table with customer_id (FK) and paymentss
        table with order_id.

        `SELECT * FROM customerss INNER JOIN orderss o on customerss.id = o.customer_id INNER JOIN
        paymentss p on o.id = p.order_id`
