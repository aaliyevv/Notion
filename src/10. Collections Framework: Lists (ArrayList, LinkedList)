- Why Use Collections Framework?


    1. Optimized data structures
    2. Increased program speed and quality

- Lists in Java


    An ordered collection allowing duplicates, can dynamically grow or shrink.

- Common implementations of List


    - **ArrayList (**uses a resizable array**)**
    - **LinkedList (**uses doubly-linked lists**)**

    Common operations: get, add, remove

- Difference between ArrayList and LinkedList


    - ArrayList allows random access to elements faster than LinkedList (better search or retrieval).
    - LinkedList faster insertions and deletions than ArrayList.
    - Memory overhead in ArrayList is lower than LinkedList.
