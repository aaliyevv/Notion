- **WebSockets**
    - **Full-duplex communication**: WebSockets enable bidirectional data flow between the client and server, enabling both the client and server to send and receive messages simultaneously over a single, persistent connection, unlike HTTP which relies on request-response cycles.
    - **Persistent connection**: Once the WebSocket handshake is complete, the connection remains open, allowing for continuous data exchange without the overhead of establishing new connections.
    - **Use cases**: WebSockets are particularly useful in real-time applications like chat systems, live feeds (e.g., Twitter or Twitch chat), and gaming platforms where low latency and high frequency of data exchange are required.
- **HTTP vs. WebSockets**

    HTTP is great for request-response communication but has limitations when it comes to real-time applications. Let's compare the two:

    | Feature | HTTP | WebSockets |
    | --- | --- | --- |
    | **Communication** | Unidirectional (client initiates) | Bidirectional (full-duplex) |
    | **Connection** | New connection per request | Persistent connection |
    | **Use case** | Ideal for static or infrequent data exchange | Ideal for real-time, fast data exchange |
    | **Efficiency** | Inefficient for frequent updates (requires polling) | More efficient for frequent, real-time updates |
