- Key Takeaways
    1. **Consistent Hashing Principles**:
        - Hash both servers and data to a circular hash space.
        - Assign data to servers by moving clockwise on the hash ring.
    2. **Advantages**:
        - Minimizes data movement during server changes.
        - Allows for balanced data distribution through virtual nodes.
    3. **Applications**:
        - Widely used in distributed databases, CDNs, and load balancers to improve reliability and
        performance in dynamic environments.
- **Introduction to Consistent Hashing**
    - **Concept**: Consistent hashing is a technique used for data distribution across servers.
    - **Usage**: Utilized by distributed systems like DynamoDB, Apache Cassandra, Discord, and Akamai
    CDN.
    - **Problem Addressed**: Balances data distribution even when servers are added or removed.
- **Background: Distributed Systems and Horizontal Scaling**
    - **Distributed Systems**: Data too large for a single server is spread across multiple servers.
    - **Horizontal Scaling**: Adding more servers to handle increased data.
    - **Goal**: Evenly distribute data across servers for predictable performance.
- **How Simple Hashing Works**
    - **Hash Function**: Uses functions like MD5 or MurmurHash to map object keys to a numerical range.
    - **Modulo Operation**: Determines server placement by taking the hash modulo the number of servers.
    - **Limitations**: Effective only if the cluster size remains fixed.
