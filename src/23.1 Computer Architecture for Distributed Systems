# #23.1 Computer Architecture for Distributed Systems

- **Lesson Overview**

    Before designing large-scale distributed systems, it’s important to understand the core components of a single computer — its essential software parts, their roles, and how they work together to execute code. This understanding helps us see the limitations of individual computers and why distributed systems are needed to overcome those limits.

- **Storage: Disk (HDD/SSD)**
    - **Definition**: The disk (also referred to as storage, hard drive, HDD, or SSD) stores data persistently, meaning the data is saved even when the computer is turned off or crashes.
    - **Key Concepts**:
        - **HDD**: Hard Disk Drive, slower, but can store large amounts of data.
        - **SSD**: Solid State Drive, faster but more expensive.
        - **Capacity**: Disk storage is typically measured in terabytes (TB), where 1 TB = 10^12 bytes, which can store a vast amount of data.
    - **Function**: Stores files, software, and system data long-term.
- **Memory: RAM (Random Access Memory)**
    - **Definition**: RAM stores data temporarily, allowing for quick read and write operations.
    - **Key Concepts**:
        - **Speed**: RAM is much faster than disk storage, with access times measured in microseconds (10^-6 seconds).
        - **Capacity**: Measured in gigabytes (GB), with typical ranges from 2GB to 32GB, though higher capacities are available.
        - **Volatile**: Data in RAM is lost if the computer is turned off or crashes.
    - **Use Case**: Used for data that the CPU needs quick access to while running programs.
- **CPU (Central Processing Unit)**
    - **Definition**: The CPU is the "brain" of the computer, responsible for executing instructions and performing calculations.
    - **Key Concepts**:
        - **Reads and Writes**: The CPU manages data flow between RAM and disk and executes code stored in memory.
        - **Speed**: CPU speeds are typically measured in gigahertz (GHz), but overall performance depends on architecture and cache utilization.
        - **Computations**: All mathematical operations, such as addition or subtraction, are performed by the CPU.
- **Cache**
    - **Definition**: The cache is a small, high-speed memory located inside the CPU, used to store frequently accessed data.
    - **Key Concepts**:
        - **Speed**: The cache is the fastest memory available, with access times in nanoseconds (10^-9 seconds).
        - **Size**: Measured in megabytes (MB), much smaller than RAM or disk.
        - **Use Case**: Speeds up data retrieval by temporarily storing data frequently accessed from RAM.
- **Data Persistence and Volatility**
    - **Disk vs. RAM**:
        - **Disk**: Data is persistent, meaning it remains saved even after a crash or shutdown.
        - **RAM**: Data is volatile, meaning it is lost when the power is off or the system crashes.
    - **Importance**: Ensuring important data (like a document you’re working on) is saved to disk prevents data loss during system crashes.
- **The Limitations of a Single Computer**

    **Hardware Limitations**:

    - **Storage Expansion**: While it’s possible to add more disks, there’s a limit to how much storage can be added.
    - **Memory (RAM) Limitations**: Increasing RAM can improve performance, but only to a certain extent due to hardware limits.
    - **CPU Speed**: CPU performance has followed **Moore’s Law**, doubling approximately every two years. However, CPU speed increases are slowing down, creating a "plateau" effect.
- **Introduction to Distributed Systems**
    - **Definition**: A distributed system is a collection of multiple computers working together to solve a larger problem.
    - **Why Distributed Systems?**
        - **Overcoming Limitations**: Individual computers have hardware limits (e.g., CPU speed, storage, memory). Combining multiple computers allows for more processing power and storage capacity.
        - **Scalability**: Distributed systems can scale to handle larger and more complex tasks than a single computer can handle.
- **Conclusion**
    - **Computer Architecture**: Understanding the core components (Disk, RAM, CPU, Cache) of a computer is essential to understanding how software operates.
    - **Limitations of Individual Computers**: While upgrading components (disk, RAM, CPU) can improve performance, all have limits.
    - **Distributed Systems**: These systems allow us to overcome the limitations of single machines by leveraging the power of multiple machines.
