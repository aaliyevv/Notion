# #34. Spring Mailing

Spring Boot simplifies the process of sending emails by providing the `spring-boot-starter-mail`.
 Here’s how to get started:

- **Step 1: Add the Mail Starter Dependency**

    In your `pom.xml`, include the following dependency to enable email functionalities:

- **Step 2: Configure Your Mail Server**

    Next, configure your SMTP (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol) server details in your
    `application.properties` file. For Gmail, the configuration would look like this:

- **Step 3: Create an Email Service**

    Create a service class to handle the email sending logic. This class will use Spring's
    `JavaMailSender` to send emails.

- **Step 4: Send Emails from Your Application**

    You can now inject the `EmailService` into any of your controllers or other services to send emails.

### Simplified Logging in Spring Boot

Spring Boot comes with a pre-configured logging framework, Logback, which is powerful and easy to
customize.

- **Step 1: Understanding Default Logging**

    By default, Spring Boot logs to the console. You can control the log levels by setting properties
    in your `application.properties` file. The standard logging levels are `TRACE`, `DEBUG`, `INFO`,
    `WARN`, and `ERROR`.

- **Step 2: Configuring Log Levels**

    You can set the logging level for the entire application or for specific packages.

- **Step 3: Logging to a File**

    To log output to a file in addition to the console, you can specify a file name or a path.

    Spring Boot will automatically handle log rotation when the file reaches 10MB.

- **Step 4: Using the Logger in Your Code**

    It is a best practice to use the SLF4J (Simple Logging Facade for Java) API to instrument your code
    with log messages.
