# #32.1 ACID

- Overview

    This tutorial explains the ACID principles that Java programmers use to ensure data security and
    integrity when working with databases.

- What is a Transaction?

    To understand ACID principles, you first need to know the concept of a Transaction. A Transaction
    is a logically executed group of operations as a single operation.
    In the context of Java: The process of ensuring that multiple SQL queries (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE) are
    all successfully completed, or that none of them are written to memory if any of them fail.

- ACID

     represents four key properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

    - Atomicity (indivisible)

        "All or nothing."
        If an error occurs in the middle of the process (for example, a light goes out or an Exception
        occurs in the code), all changes are canceled (Rollback).

        Example:Transfer money from a bank account

    - Consistency

        A transaction must bring the database from one valid state to another. All constraints,
        cascading rules, and triggers defined for the database must be preserved.

        - Example:

            If the database has a constraint that the "Age" column cannot be negative, and an attempt
            is made to write a negative number to it as a result of a transaction, the transaction
            should not be completed.

    - Isolation (Non-interference)

        Transactions executing at the same time should not affect each other. If a transaction has not
        yet completed, its changes should not be visible to other transactions.

        Example: Two managers are trying to sell the last product left in the warehouse at the same
        time.

    - Durability (Guaranteed to be remembered)

        Changes made after a transaction is successfully completed (Commit) must remain permanently in
        memory. Even if the system crashes or has a power outage, that data must not be lost.

- Application in Java (JDBC Example)

    Java uses the Connection object to manage transactions. By default, autoCommit mode is enabled
    (each request is written to memory immediately). This should be disabled to enforce ACID principles.
