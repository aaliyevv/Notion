- What is a Transaction?

    To understand ACID principles, you first need to know the concept of a Transaction. A Transaction
    is a logically executed group of operations as a single operation.
    In the context of Java: The process of ensuring that multiple SQL queries (e.g. INSERT, UPDATE) are
    all successfully completed, or that none of them are written to memory if any of them fail.

- ACID

     represents four key properties: Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability.

    - Atomicity (indivisible)

        "All or nothing."
        If an error occurs in the middle of the process (for example, a light goes out or an Exception
        occurs in the code), all changes are canceled (Rollback).
