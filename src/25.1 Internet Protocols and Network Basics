# #25.1 Internet Protocols and Networking Basics

- **Internet Protocol (IP)**

    is essential for data communication between machines over a network. It defines how data is packaged into IP packets.

    - IP Packets
        - **IP Header**: Metadata about the packet, including source and destination IP addresses.
        - **Data Payload**: The actual data being transmitted.

        ### Structure of an IP Packet

        ```
        +------------+------------+
        | IP Header  |   Data     |
        +------------+------------+
        ```

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
    - **Sequencing Packets**: Each TCP packet includes a sequence number in its header.
    - **Ensuring Order**: The receiver uses these numbers to reassemble data correctly.
    - **Reliable Transmission**: TCP manages data integrity and retransmits lost packets.

        ```
        +------------+---------------------+
        | IP Header  |    IP Data          |
        +------------+---------------------+
                              |
                              v
                       +------------+------------+
                       | TCP Header |   Data     |
                       +------------+------------+

        ```

- **Example of role of TCP**

    Sending a Book Through the Mail

    - Imagine needing to send a book using only envelopes:
        - **Breaking Down Data**: Tear out pages and distribute them into multiple envelopes.
        - **Reassembly Challenge**: Without page numbers, the recipient can't easily reconstruct the book.
- **Layers of Communication Protocols**

    Data transmission involves multiple protocol layers:

    **Network Layer (IP)**: Handles device addressing and routing between machines.

    **Transport Layer (TCP)**: Manages reliable data transport and sequencing.

    **Application Layer (HTTP)**: Used by software applications for network communication.

        +-------------------+  <-- Application Layer (HTTP)
        | Application Layer |
        +-------------------+
        | Transport Layer   |  <-- Transport Layer (TCP)
        +-------------------+
        | Network Layer     |  <-- Network Layer (IP)
        +-------------------+

- **Public vs. Private IP Addresses**
    - Public IP Addresses
        - **Definition**: Addresses accessible over the internet.
        - **Usage**: Required for servers to be reachable by clients globally.

    - Private IP Addresses
        - **Definition**: Addresses used within a local network (LAN), not accessible publicly.
        - **Role of Routers**: Assign private IPs to local devices and use a single public IP for internet communication.
    - Public vs. Private IP Addresses Diagram

        ```
                        [Internet]
                            |
                    [Router with Public IP]
                            |
                   +--------+--------+
                   |                 |
             [Device A]         [Device B]
            (Private IPs in LAN)

        ```


- **Static and Dynamic IP Addresses**
    - Static IP Addresses
        - **Characteristics**: Permanent and unchanging.
        - **Importance**: Essential for servers that need consistent accessibility.
    - Dynamic IP Addresses
        - **Characteristics**: Assigned temporarily and can change over time.
        - **Dynamic DNS**: Services that map a changing IP to a consistent domain name.

        [Router]
          |
        [Devices with Dynamic IPs]

        ```

- **Ports**
    - **Definition**: Numerical identifiers (16-bit values ranging from 0 to 65,535) used to manage multiple communication channels on a single IP address.
    - **Purpose**: Allow multiple services to run on a single machine without interference.

        ```
        [Server IP]
             |
        +----------+----------+
        | Port 80  | Port 443 |
        +----------+----------+

        ```

- **Common Ports and Protocols**
    - **Port 80**: Default for HTTP traffic.
    - **Port 443**: Default for HTTPS traffic.
    - **Port 22**: Commonly used for SSH connections.
- **Accessing Local Applications**

    The `localhost` and Loopback Address

    - **`localhost`**: A hostname that refers to your own computer.
    - **IP Address**: `127.0.0.1` is the loopback address used to test network applications locally.
    - **Usage**: Allows developers to run and access applications on their machine without external network communication.

              |
        [127.0.0.1 or localhost]
