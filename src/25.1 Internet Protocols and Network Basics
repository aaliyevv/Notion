# #25.1 Internet Protocols and Networking Basics

- **Internet Protocol (IP)**

    is essential for data communication between machines over a network. It defines how data is packaged into IP packets.

    - IP Packets
        - **IP Header**: Metadata about the packet, including source and destination IP addresses.
        - **Data Payload**: The actual data being transmitted.

        ### Structure of an IP Packet

        ```
        +------------+------------+
        | IP Header  |   Data     |
        +------------+------------+
        ```

- **TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)**
    - **Sequencing Packets**: Each TCP packet includes a sequence number in its header.
    - **Ensuring Order**: The receiver uses these numbers to reassemble data correctly.
    - **Reliable Transmission**: TCP manages data integrity and retransmits lost packets.

        ```
        +------------+---------------------+
        | IP Header  |    IP Data          |
        +------------+---------------------+
                              |
                              v
                       +------------+------------+
                       | TCP Header |   Data     |
                       +------------+------------+

        ```

- **Example of role of TCP**

    Sending a Book Through the Mail

    - Imagine needing to send a book using only envelopes:
        - **Breaking Down Data**: Tear out pages and distribute them into multiple envelopes.
        - **Reassembly Challenge**: Without page numbers, the recipient can't easily reconstruct the book.
- **Layers of Communication Protocols**

    Data transmission involves multiple protocol layers:

    **Network Layer (IP)**: Handles device addressing and routing between machines.

    **Transport Layer (TCP)**: Manages reliable data transport and sequencing.

    **Application Layer (HTTP)**: Used by software applications for network communication.

        | Application Layer |
        +-------------------+
        | Transport Layer   |  <-- Transport Layer (TCP)
        +-------------------+
