# #32. Spring Cloud Gateway

- Overview

    `Clients (Web/Mobile) → API Gateway → Microservices`

    API Gateway is a single entry point for all clients (Web, Mobile, External Apps) in microservice architecture. It centralizes functions such as routing, security, and monitoring.

    Example: gw - 8080, payment - 8081, user - 8082, warehouse - 8083. Client sends all requests to 8080 port and api gateway devides request according to requests.

- **Microservice**

    Microservice architecture is a programming style that divides large applications into smaller, independent services. Each service:

    - **Runs independently**: Has its own database and business logic
    - **Connects**: Communicates via APIs
    - **Deploys separately**: Each service can be released separately
    - If we have problem it affects only this service not whole app
- **Monolit vs Microservice**


    | Monolithic Architecture  | Microservice Architecture |
    | --- | --- |
    | Single large application |  Many small services |
    | Single database | Each service has its own database |
    | Difficult to scale |  Easy to scale |
    | Single language/technology |  Different technologies |
