# #32. Spring Cloud Gateway

- Overview

    `Clients (Web/Mobile) → API Gateway → Microservices`

    API Gateway is a single entry point for all clients (Web, Mobile, External Apps) in microservice
    architecture. It centralizes functions such as routing, security, and monitoring.

    Example: gw - 8080, payment - 8081, user - 8082, warehouse - 8083. Client sends all requests to
    8080 port and api gateway devides request according to requests.

- **Microservice**

    Microservice architecture is a programming style that divides large applications into smaller,
    independent services. Each service:

    - **Runs independently**: Has its own database and business logic
    - **Connects**: Communicates via APIs
    - **Deploys separately**: Each service can be released separately
    - If we have problem it affects only this service not whole app
- **Monolit vs Microservice**


    | Monolithic Architecture  | Microservice Architecture |
    | --- | --- |
    | Single large application |  Many small services |
    | Single database | Each service has its own database |
    | Difficult to scale |  Easy to scale |
    | Single language/technology |  Different technologies |
- Spring Cloud Gateway

     is an API Gateway solution in a microservice architecture, provided by Spring.

- Key Responsibilities & Architecture


    | **Responsibility** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Routing** | Directs traffic based on rules. |
    | **Security** | Centralizes authentication & authorization. |
    | **Resilience** | Manages failures with circuit breakers & retries. |
    | **Observability** | Centralizes logging, tracing, and metrics. |
- Core Concept

    Spring Cloud Gateway is built on 3 main "pillars". It is important to understand them:

    - 1. Route

        The cornerstone of the Gateway. A route consists of:

        - **ID:** The unique name of the route (e.g. `department-service`).
        - **URI:** The target address where the request will go (e.g. `http://localhost:9090`).
        - **Predicate & Filter:** Conditions and Operations.
    - 2. Predicate

        Answers the question "Should I let this request in or not?"

        - **Path:** Does the URL start with `/api/departments`?
        - **Method:** Is the request a `POST` method?
        - **Time:** Did the request arrive during business hours?
    - 3. Filter

        To make changes to the request **before** it reaches the target or **after** the response
        returns to the client.

        - Add `Header` to the request.
        - Change the URL (`StripPrefix`).
        - Measure the duration of the request.
- Gateway Building Blocks
    - **Route**: The fundamental unit. Contains an ID, a destination URI, a set of Predicates, and a
    set of Filters.
    - **Predicate**: A condition to match an HTTP request (e.g., by path, method, or header). If it
    matches, the route is processed.
    - **Filter**: Logic to modify the request or response before or after sending it to the destination
    URI.
- Running the Project
    1. **Start Microservice (Port 8081):**Bash

        `./gradlew run -PmainClass=com.ltclab.microservice.UserServiceApplication`

    2. **Start Gateway (Port 8080):**Bash

        `./gradlew run -PmainClass=com.ltclab.Main`

    3. **Test the Gateway:**Bash

        `# Request is sent to localhost:8080 and routed to localhost:8081
        curl http://localhost:8080/api/users`

- Configuration Examples

    Routes can be configured via YAML (preferred) or Java code.

- Advanced Features & Filters (Examples)

    Protects the system from cascading failures. If the target service is down, it forwards the
    request to a fallback URI.

    Controls the frequency of requests to prevent abuse. Often implemented with Redis.

    Distributes requests across multiple instances of a service registered with a discovery server.

- Common Issues
    - **404 Not Found**: Check your `Path` predicate and `StripPrefix` filter logic. Ensure route order
    is correct (most specific first).
    - **CORS Errors**: Configure `spring.cloud.gateway.globalcors` in your YAML.
    - **503 Service Unavailable**: Ensure backend services are running and reachable. If using `lb://`,
    check service discovery registration.

- application.yaml
    - code

        server:
        port: 9091

        spring:
        application:
        name: api-gateway
        cloud:
        gateway:
        routes:
        - id: department-service
        uri: [http://localhost:9090](http://localhost:9090/)
        predicates:
        - Path=/api/departments/**

        ```
            - id: employee-service
              uri: <http://localhost:9090>
              predicates:
                - Path=/api/employee/**
        ```

        logging:
        level:
        org.springframework.cloud.gateway: TRACE
        org.springframework.http.server.reactive: DEBUG
        org.springframework.web.reactive: DEBUG
        reactor.netty: DEBUG


    We send requests to 9091 (as a api gateway) and it forwards to port based on predicates info.
