# #32. Spring Cloud Gateway

- Overview

    `Clients (Web/Mobile) → API Gateway → Microservices`

    API Gateway is a single entry point for all clients (Web, Mobile, External Apps) in microservice
    architecture. It centralizes functions such as routing, security, and monitoring.

    Example: gw - 8080, payment - 8081, user - 8082, warehouse - 8083. Client sends all requests to
    8080 port and api gateway devides request according to requests.

- **Microservice**

    Microservice architecture is a programming style that divides large applications into smaller,
    independent services. Each service:

    - **Runs independently**: Has its own database and business logic
    - **Connects**: Communicates via APIs
    - **Deploys separately**: Each service can be released separately
    - If we have problem it affects only this service not whole app
- **Monolit vs Microservice**


    | Monolithic Architecture  | Microservice Architecture |
    | --- | --- |
    | Single large application |  Many small services |
    | Single database | Each service has its own database |
    | Difficult to scale |  Easy to scale |
    | Single language/technology |  Different technologies |
- Spring Cloud Gateway

     is an API Gateway solution in a microservice architecture, provided by Spring.

- Key Responsibilities & Architecture


    | **Responsibility** | **Description** |
    | --- | --- |
    | **Routing** | Directs traffic based on rules. |
    | **Security** | Centralizes authentication & authorization. |
    | **Resilience** | Manages failures with circuit breakers & retries. |
    | **Observability** | Centralizes logging, tracing, and metrics. |
- Core Concept

    Spring Cloud Gateway is built on 3 main "pillars". It is important to understand them:

    - 1. Route

        The cornerstone of the Gateway. A route consists of:

        - **ID:** The unique name of the route (e.g. `department-service`).
        - **URI:** The target address where the request will go (e.g. `http://localhost:9090`).
        - **Predicate & Filter:** Conditions and Operations.
    - 2. Predicate

        Answers the question "Should I let this request in or not?"

        - **Path:** Does the URL start with `/api/departments`?
        - **Method:** Is the request a `POST` method?
        - **Time:** Did the request arrive during business hours?
    - 3. Filter

        To make changes to the request **before** it reaches the target or **after** the response
        returns to the client.

        - Add `Header` to the request.
        - Change the URL (`StripPrefix`).
        - Measure the duration of the request.
- Gateway Building Blocks
    - **Route**: The fundamental unit. Contains an ID, a destination URI, a set of Predicates, and a
    set of Filters.
    - **Predicate**: A condition to match an HTTP request (e.g., by path, method, or header). If it
    matches, the route is processed.
    - **Filter**: Logic to modify the request or response before or after sending it to the destination
    URI.
