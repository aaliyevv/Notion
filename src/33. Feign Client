# #33. Feign Client

- Definition

    In a microservice architecture, one service often needs to receive information from another service
    (for example, an "Order Service" calling a "Product Service"). Previously, `RestTemplate` was used
    for this, but this method required a lot of "boilerplate" (repeated) code.

- **Spring Feign Client**

    Spring Feign Client is a declarative REST client. This means that you simply create a **Java
    Interface** and decorate it with annotations. Spring Boot automatically creates an implementation
    for this interface and handles HTTP requests. It looks like you are calling a local method, but in
    reality the request is going to another service over the network.

- Step-by-Step Installation
    - Step 1: Adding Dependencies

        You must have `spring-cloud-starter-openfeign` library in your project (pom.xml or build.gradle).

        *Note: Spring Cloud versions must match Spring Boot version.*
