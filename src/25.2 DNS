- **What is a Server?**

    •	**Definition**: A server is essentially a computer with a public IP address.

    •	**Purpose**: Servers are configured to allow external traffic and handle requests from users.

    •	**Functionality**: When you send a request (e.g., entering a URL), the server receives it, processes it, and responds appropriately.

- **Firewall Configuration**

    •	Public servers have firewalls configured to allow requests from external users.

    •	On the contrary, for private devices like personal routers, firewalls block external traffic to ensure security.

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**

    The Domain Name System (DNS) acts as the phone book of the internet, linking domain names to IP addresses.

    - **DNS Request Flow**

        •	When you type a domain name (e.g., google.com), DNS converts it into an IP address and routes your request to the corresponding server.

        •	This system is essential for user-friendly navigation on the internet, translating human-readable domain names into machine-friendly IP addresses.

    - **Buying a Domain**

        •	When you buy a domain (e.g., google.com), you own the primary domain name.

        •	You can manage the DNS records, which map the domain to an IP address (usually via an A-record for address mapping).

- **Components of a URL**

    A URL (Uniform Resource Locator) is composed of several parts:

    - **Protocol**

        •	**HTTP / HTTPS**: The protocol specifies how data is transferred between the client and server.

        •	**Other Protocols**: FTP (File Transfer Protocol), or even a local file protocol for accessing files on your own system, can also be used.

    - **Domain Structure**
        - **Top-Level Domain (TLD)**

            The last part of a domain, such as .com, .io, .jp.

            •	**Country Code TLDs**: Examples include .jp (Japan) and many others.

            •	Managed by ICANN (The Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers).

        - **Primary Domain**

            The core part of a domain, e.g., google.com.

            •	When you purchase a domain, you own this section.

        - **Subdomains**

            A domain section that precedes the primary domain (e.g., www.google.com or domains.google.com).

            •	Subdomains can be used for organizing content or services within a site.

            •	They are optional, and www is a common subdomain that historically was used but is no longer necessary.

- **Subdomains**

    •	**Examples**: www.google.com, maps.google.com, domains.google.com.

    •	Subdomains allow the creation of unique sections or services within a website.

    **Example**: Google uses subdomains to separate services (e.g., domains.google.com for its domain service).

- **URL Path and Query Parameters**

    •	**Path**: The part of the URL that follows the domain, typically pointing to specific resources on a website (e.g., google.com/maps).

    •	**Query Parameters**: Optional parts of the URL used to pass additional data to the server (e.g., google.com/search?q=cats).

    They are typically used for dynamic content or searches.

- **Conclusion**
    - **Server**: A computer with a public IP address that handles requests.
    - **DNS**: Translates domain names to IP addresses, guiding requests to the correct server.
    - **Subdomains**: Optional parts of a domain used to organize different services or sections of a site.
    - **URL**: Consists of the protocol, domain, subdomains, path, and query parameters.
