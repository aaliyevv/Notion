- **What is a Server?**

    •	**Definition**: A server is essentially a computer with a public IP address.

    •	**Purpose**: Servers are configured to allow external traffic and handle requests from users.

    •	**Functionality**: When you send a request (e.g., entering a URL), the server receives it, processes it, and responds appropriately.

- **Firewall Configuration**

    •	Public servers have firewalls configured to allow requests from external users.

    •	On the contrary, for private devices like personal routers, firewalls block external traffic to ensure security.

- **Domain Name System (DNS)**

    The Domain Name System (DNS) acts as the phone book of the internet, linking domain names to IP addresses.

    - **DNS Request Flow**

        •	When you type a domain name (e.g., google.com), DNS converts it into an IP address and routes your request to the corresponding server.

        •	This system is essential for user-friendly navigation on the internet, translating human-readable domain names into machine-friendly IP addresses.

    - **Buying a Domain**

        •	When you buy a domain (e.g., google.com), you own the primary domain name.

        •	You can manage the DNS records, which map the domain to an IP address (usually via an A-record for address mapping).
