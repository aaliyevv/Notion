# #7 Java Memory Allocation: Heap and Stack

- JDK, JRE and JVM:

    JVM (Java Virtual Machine) - all java code is built and run on it.

    JDK (Java Development Kit) -  a software development kit (collection) that provides the tools,
     libraries to create, compile, and debug Java applications. It includes the [Java Runtime
     Environment (JRE)](https://www.google.com/search?rlz=1C5CHFA_enAZ1077AZ1077&cs=1&sca_esv=

      (for running Java programs), a Java Compiler(which converts source code to bytecode),
     and Application Programming Interfaces (APIs).

- **Notes:**

    If we compare Strings with the same address and the same value it give us true.

    If we compare with the use of .equals it compares only value.

    Reference, I mean non primitive types change inside methods and outside of the methods

    If method call itself it will be recursion and it cause stack overflow.

    Heap overflow: For instance, we add object to list continuously.

    - Heap and Stack

        İf we create an object it will live in the heap, naming the object, call the method or create
        new field will keep in the stack.

        Stack is LIFO (Last in First out) type memory allocation but in heap data exist by addressing.
         Big datas store in heap, small size datas store in stack because of this stack is speed faster
          than heap.

    - Garbage Collector

        **a system that automatically manages memory by identifying and removing objects and data that
        are no longer in use by a program, preventing memory leaks and freeing up space for new
        allocations**.

        If workers and resources are limited, we must decide whether to spend them on cleaning up trash
        or getting work done.
