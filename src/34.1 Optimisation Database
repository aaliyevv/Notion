- **Introduction**

    As applications grow, so does the data and user base. Increased load can cause slow response times,
    timeouts, crashes. **Scaling** ensures smooth operations and a good user experience.


### **Strategies for Scaling**

- **Indexing**

    Similar to a book index, helps locate specific data quickly.

    **Benefits:**

    - Faster query execution (e.g., finding orders by Order ID).
    - Effective for range queries and sorted data.

    **Trade-offs**:

    - Slower write operations due to index updates.
    - Balance is key in selecting fields to index.
